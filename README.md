## üîÑ LLM Tools: Building AI-Driven ERP

We're seeing tremendous potential by integrating reasoning/assistant models like ChatGPT, Claude, and others into Odoo. These models can query the Odoo database via functions and interact with server actions for data manipulation.

### Why This Matters

This approach has the potential to revolutionize how users interact with Odoo:
- AI-driven automation of repetitive tasks
- Smart querying & decision-making inside Odoo
- A flexible ecosystem for custom AI assistants

### Help Wanted - Let's Build This Together!

We are committed to keeping this project truly open source and building an open AI layer for Odoo ERP that benefits everyone. We're looking for contributions in these areas:

- Unit tests & CI/CD
- Security & access control improvements
- Multi-model support enhancement
- Localization & translations
- Documentation and examples

## ü§ù Contributing

We welcome contributions! Here's how you can help:

1. **Issues**: Report bugs or suggest features through the Issues tab
2. **Discussions**: Join conversations about development priorities and approaches
3. **Pull Requests**: Submit code contributions for fixes or new features

### Guidelines

- Follow the existing code style and structure

- Include tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as necessary

## üîÆ Roadmap

- [x] Enhanced RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) capabilities (Foundation built, further enhancements planned)
- [x] Function calling support for model-driven actions (Framework exists via `llm_tool`, expansion planned)
- [ ] Multi-modal content handling (images, audio)
- [x] Advanced prompt templates and management (Basic management via `llm_prompt`, advanced features planned)
- [ ] Integration with other Odoo modules (CRM, HR, etc.)
- [x] Improving assistant frameworks for complex task automation (Foundation via `llm_assistant`, improvements planned)
