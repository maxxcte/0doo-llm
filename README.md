## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

You can install these modules by cloning the repository and making them available in your Odoo addons path:

1. Clone this repository to your preferred location:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/apexive/odoo-llm
   ```

2. Make the modules available to Odoo by either:
   - Cloning directly into your Odoo addons directory, or
   - Copying the module subdirectories to your Odoo extra-addons directory:
     ```bash
     cp -r /path/to/odoo-llm/* /path/to/your/odoo/extra-addons/
     ```

3. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Restart your Odoo server to detect the new modules

5. Install the modules through the Odoo Apps menu

## üöÄ Quick Start Guide

Thanks to Odoo's dependency management, you only need to install the end modules to get started quickly:

1. **Basic Chat with AI Assistants**:
   - Install `llm_openai` (or another provider like `llm_anthropic` or `llm_mistral`)
   - Install `llm_assistant` for specialized AI assistants
   
   This will automatically install all required dependencies including `llm`, `llm_thread`, `llm_prompt`, and `llm_tool`.

2. **Knowledge Base (RAG) Setup**:
   - Install one of the vector store integrations:
     - `llm_pgvector` (requires PostgreSQL with pgvector extension)
     - `llm_chroma` (requires Chroma DB)
     - `llm_qdrant` (requires Qdrant vector database)
   
   This will automatically install all required dependencies including `llm_knowledge`, `llm_store`, and `llm_resource`.

With just these two steps, you'll have a complete LLM integration with chat capabilities, assistants, and knowledge retrieval.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

After installation:

1. Navigate to LLM ‚Üí Configuration ‚Üí Providers
2. Create a new provider with your API credentials
3. Set up models for the provider (can be done automatically using "Fetch Models")
4. Grant appropriate access rights to users

## üîÑ LLM Tools: Building AI-Driven ERP

We're seeing tremendous potential by integrating reasoning/assistant models like ChatGPT, Claude, and others into Odoo. These models can query the Odoo database via functions and interact with server actions for data manipulation.

### Why This Matters

This approach has the potential to revolutionize how users interact with Odoo:
- AI-driven automation of repetitive tasks
- Smart querying & decision-making inside Odoo
- A flexible ecosystem for custom AI assistants

### Help Wanted - Let's Build This Together!

We are committed to keeping this project truly open source and building an open AI layer for Odoo ERP that benefits everyone. We're looking for contributions in these areas:

- Unit tests & CI/CD
- Security & access control improvements
- Multi-model support enhancement
- Localization & translations
- Documentation and examples

## ü§ù Contributing

We welcome contributions! Here's how you can help:

1. **Issues**: Report bugs or suggest features through the Issues tab
2. **Discussions**: Join conversations about development priorities and approaches
3. **Pull Requests**: Submit code contributions for fixes or new features

### Guidelines

- Follow the existing code style and structure
- Write clean, well-documented code
- Include tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as necessary

## üîÆ Roadmap

- [x] Enhanced RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) capabilities (Foundation built, further enhancements planned)
- [x] Function calling support for model-driven actions (Framework exists via `llm_tool`, expansion planned)
- [ ] Multi-modal content handling (images, audio)
- [x] Advanced prompt templates and management (Basic management via `llm_prompt`, advanced features planned)
- [ ] Integration with other Odoo modules (CRM, HR, etc.)
- [x] Improving assistant frameworks for complex task automation (Foundation via `llm_assistant`, improvements planned)
